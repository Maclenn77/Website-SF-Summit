## Microverse - Capstone Project (Conference)

A webpage for a Sci-Fi Summit, based on the design of [Cindy Shin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015). Developed with HTML5/CSS and Bootstrap 4.

#### Navbar

The Navbar section width has a menu that expands from up of 768px, and it shows like a toggler for the mobile version. I achieved this feature with Bootstrap.

#### Main
The main section contains all the needed info on each HTML page. I combined bootstrap and CSS files for the style.

In the index file, I used a jumbotron in the first part. I preferred to use semantic tags for dividing the sections in CSS. I used divs only for styling.

Index and About have a section showing the partners of the event. In the index page, the website only displays this section on the desktop version.

#### Footer

All the pages have a footer with Logo and Copyright info. In the index page, the website only displays this section on the desktop version.
